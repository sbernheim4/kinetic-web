		<p class='header-text'>
			Kinetic was founded to help college students move beyond theoretical conversations to meaningful action. Kinetic began at Williams College with 15 college students seeking more effective ways to address social issues. It has expanded into a national network of college students, in which chapters across the US are working to affect positive, tangible change in their communities.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class='header-text'>
			The Kinetic Global Network provides students with the structure and resources to carry out a three-part process of research, design, and implementation. The Network provides access to an expert network, mentorship, a tested methodology, valuable digital resources and a network of smart and passionate fellow social innovators at universities across the country.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class='header-text'>
			 Ultimately, Kinetic Global envisions a culture of boldly engaged citizens who combine empathy, analysis, and action to create innovative solutions to social issues

	<h2 class="header"> Key Issues </h2>
	<div>
		<p class="text-content">
			The power of the Kinetic Global Network is in the number of motivated college students working on the same issues and learning from each other in the process. For this reason, Kinetic Global has selected three core issues that have interested our members in the past.
		</p>

		<p class="text-content">
			These issues - homelessness, food insecurity, and environmental sustainability- affect a large number of people in all regions of the country, making them critical issues to address.
		</p>

		<p class="text-content">
			Kinetic Global has compiled databases of mentors and experts for each issue. These resources should facilitate teamsâ€™ understandings of the issue during the research phase and other guidance and advice during the implementation stages
