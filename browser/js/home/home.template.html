		<h2 class='header header-about-us'> About Us </h2>
		<p class='header-text'> 
			Kinetic was founded to help ambitious students impact real change in their local area. What began as a group of 15 college students seeking more effective ways to address social issues has expanded into a network of students in chapters across the US, working within and across communities to improve the world around them. 
		</p>
		<br>	
		<p class='header-text'> 
			The Kinetic Global Network provides these students with resources and a starting point upon which to build their models. The Network provides access to mentor advice, Kinetic’s easy-to-follow methodology, digital resources, and other like-minded students in Universities across the country.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class='header-text'> 
			Ultimately, Kinetic Global envisions a culture of boldly engaged citizens who combine empathy, analysis, and action to create innovative solutions to social issues.

	<h2> Sponsored Issues for 2016 </h2>

	<p>
		The power of Kinetic Global Network is in the number of motivated college students
		working on the same issues so that they may serve as resources to learn from each
		other. As such, Kinetic Global has selected three sponsored issues that have shown a
		great deal of interest among our members.
	</p>

	<p>
		These issues, homelessness, food insecurity, and environmental sustainability are
		pervasive issues meaning that they affect a large number of people in all regions of
		the country. Kinetic Global has compiled databases of mentors and experts on these
		issues that will help facilitate your understanding of the issue during the research
		phase and offer guidance and advice on your team's path towards implementation.
